# Projects on Raspberry Pi Pico W using Micro-Python

Welcome to the Raspberry Pi Pico W microcontroller projects repository! This repository contains a collection of small projects developed using MicroPython on the [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/) for the Raspberry Pi Pico W.

## Pico W vs Pico

In these projects, I specifically use the Pico W. Pico W is similar to the Pico except that it has a built-in Wi-Fi module on the micro-controller iteslf unlike Pico. However, a lot of the projects in this repository could be run on both and I will specifically mention when a certain project is Pico W exclusive.

## Microcontroller Pin Configuration

Before diving into the projects, it's essential to understand the pin configuration of the Raspberry Pi Pico W. The pin configuration is similar for both Raspberry Pi Pico and Pico W. Refer to the following image for a visual representation:

## Installing and Configuring MicroPython with Thonny IDE

To get started with MicroPython on your Raspberry Pi Pico W using the Thonny IDE, follow these steps:

1. Connect your Raspberry Pi Pico W to your computer using a micro USB cable.
2. Download and install the [Thonny IDE](https://thonny.org/) on your computer.
3. Download the latest MicroPython firmware for Raspberry Pi Pico W from the official website.
4. Open Thonny IDE and select the Raspberry Pi Pico W as the interpreter.
5. Flash the MicroPython firmware onto the Raspberry Pi Pico W or simply follow the instructions provided by [this link](https://t.ly/MR9XR).

Once you've completed these steps, you're ready to start experimenting with the projects!
