# User-Controlled RGB LED with Raspberry Pi Pico W

## Description
This project is an upgrade on the previous project. It also demonstrates how to control an RGB (Red, Green, Blue) LED using Raspberry Pi Pico W. But this time, user can personally the choice of color. The intensity of each color is adjusted using Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), allowing for a wide range of colors to be displayed.

## Components Required
- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- RGB LED
- 220 ohm resistors (3)
- Wires

## Circuit Schematics
The circuit diagram illustrates the inner logic of an RGB LED and its pin configuration.
